# Minerva Tutoring | One-on-One Student Tutoring at the University of Michigan

Website Live @ [https://minerva.up.railway.app/](https://minerva.up.railway.app/)

Sleep deprived? Co-dependent on coffee? Cramming the night before the test? Saying a Hail Mary that the few things you memorized will be on the test? Constantly contemplating dropping out of school because of your GPA? We know your pain. As a group of 5 fellow University of Michigan students we've been in your place a few too many times. We found in our struggles we couldnâ€™t even find the academic help we needed when we needed it (meaning when we were in panic mode a few days prior to a test). Frankly, we were just too lazy to aimlessly find a tutor through Facebook or word of mouth so we decided to take out the work for you. Welcome to Minerva, find all fellow University of Michigan tutors in one place for the class you need. For UofM students, by UofM students.
